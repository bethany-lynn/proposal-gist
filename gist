Project Proposal
an app for user to create a D&D character, interact with the character sheet/add and update info
will also be able to save login and save information, and create multiple characters


Technologies Required
http://www.dnd5eapi.co/
D&D API with a pretty wide amount of information
will use for class descriptions, race descriptions, and spell/attack information


Data Model

Roadmap

MVP
user login with username/email and password
creation page - lists of classes and races (API) - lists of spells and attacks (API)
profile page with saved character information and option to add more sheets


2.0
add all playing die to use during campaigns
autmatically update modifiers depending on stat input (ex - wisdom = 16 will automatically give a 3 modifier)
automatically provide all strengths depending on class and race, and give a basic pack of items for each starting character - (can be edited if the user doesn't want to work with the default)


Nice-to-haves
connect with other players and add party members to group
create a DM specific page with features to add monsters and map information
give DM authority over certain information to override player sheets (ex: an alert button that a monster has appeared)


Notes
I want to prioritize the sheet being easy to work with, flexible, designed aesthetically well, and easy to build upon.
